Accessing Database
  Programs can be accessed through JDBC (Java Database Console)
    This doesn't work on android, however
  Database driver
  Management Console
    direct access into database. Not through a software program
    1. Local File Access
      Embedded database. Not trying to share it with anyone else
    2. Client-server
      Database is on a different computer than program.
      Allows multi-user access over network
For asteroids, we're using Local File Access database
