use Collection classes
  sets
  maps
  lists
  trees

1) read in dictionary file into a set
2) trim dictionary down to correct length (given by user)
3) ask user for guess (ex 'a')
4) take set of words, partition into subsets
  1) map<String, Set<String> >
  2) iterate over each word in set and compute pattern string for each word
    String makePattern(String word, char guess){
      *iterate through characters in word
      *if char matches, replace with char
      *if not replace with '-'
    }
    (pattern string '--a--')
  3) Add word to map key with matching pattern (pattern string is key. Word is value)
  a) set of words with no 'a's at all
  b) set of all words in 1st position only
  c) set of all words in 2nd position only
  d) etc...
5) select largest subset, replace entire set for next round
6) give feedback to user (was there an 'a' or not?)
